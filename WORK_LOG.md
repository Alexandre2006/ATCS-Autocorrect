| Mar 13 | 12:45-13:45 | Tried reusing LCS, but came up with a slightly different algorithm. I think with the standard LCS algorithm, you could probably get to something similar to edit distance, but only addition / removing characters instead of substitution. With this algorithm, you can also calculate for substitution, which definitely helps with getting a more accurate edit distance for autocorrect. |

Not currently in use though. |
