| Mar 13 | 12:45-13:45 | Tried reusing LCS, but came up with a slightly different algorithm. I think with the standard LCS algorithm, you could probably get to something similar to edit distance, but only addition / removing characters instead of substitution. With this algorithm, you can also calculate for substitution, which definitely helps with getting a more accurate edit distance for autocorrect. |

Not currently in use though. |

That meant reworking how limit works (to not be a word limit, but a limit of edit distance), and removing features such as not calculating anything if a perfect match was found. |

The Autocorrect class itself will not be managed by Spring Boot, but both application variants will (TUI and GUI). I've upgraded the tests to be compatible with spring boot and the new file structure. |
