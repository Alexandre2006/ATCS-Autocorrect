| Mar 13 | 12:45-13:45 | Tried reusing LCS, but came up with a slightly different algorithm. I think with the standard LCS algorithm, you could probably get to something similar to edit distance, but only addition / removing characters instead of substitution. With this algorithm, you can also calculate for substitution, which definitely helps with getting a more accurate edit distance for autocorrect. |
| Mar 13 | 13:45-14:15 | Added some tests, and a way to limit the search that way we don't calculate any unnecessary steps. Not currently in use though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Mar 13 | 14:15-14:45 | Made it compatible with included tests! That meant reworking how limit works (to not be a word limit, but a limit of edit distance), and removing features such as not calculating anything if a perfect match was found.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Mar 13 | 17:00-18:00 | Upgraded the application to use maven and Spring Boot! The Autocorrect class itself will not be managed by Spring Boot, but both application variants will (TUI and GUI). I've upgraded the tests to be compatible with spring boot and the new file structure.                                                                                                                              |
| Mar 13 | 18:00-18:30 | Cleaned up the Autocorrect class, adding back features that I had removed to improve support for tests. I also added a debug function to print out the array, which I had used before but scrapped. This was quite useful as I found that the way I was exiting early for edit distance was actually broken. So, this helped me debug this and fix it.                                       |
| Mar 13 | 18:30-19:30 | Began working on the UI... it's working... ish? it's really ugly and there are a bunch of bugs :(                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Mar 13 | 19:30-22:00 | HOLY I GOT CARRIED AWAY. The UI looks a lot nicer now, there is proper error handling, and... well it's just really good. You should try it! Why did this take so long: 1. learned spring boot... 2. learned mustache... 3. learned htmx... 4. CSS is really hard :(... to used to having copilot write it lol... but i made it!                                                             |
| Mar 13 | 22:00-23:00 | Configured app to have support for a TUI, not a CLI. Will eventually implement, but it was already a pain figuring out how args worked in spring boot. And then learning a little bit about Spring Shell! Really cool project, but have to go to sleep... it's late.                                                                                                                         |
